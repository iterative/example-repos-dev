The Git repo generated by this script is intended to be published on
https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started-cv. Make sure the Github repo
exists first and that you have appropriate write permissions.

Run these commands to force push it:

```
cd build/example-get-started-cv
git remote add origin git@github.com:<slug>/example-get-started-cv.git
git push --force origin main
git push --force origin tune-architecture
git push --force origin increase-epochs
git push --force origin --tags
```

Run these to drop and then rewrite the experiment references on the repo:

```
dvc exp remove -A -g origin
dvc exp push origin -A
```

To create a PR from the "tune-architecture" branch:

gh pr create -t "Run experiments tuning architecture" \
   -B main -H tune-architecture

Finally, return to the directory where you started:

cd ../..

You may remove the generated repo with:

rm -fR build
