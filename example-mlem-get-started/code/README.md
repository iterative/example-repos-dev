## Installation

Python 3.6+ is required to run code from this repo.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-mlem-get-started
$ cd example-mlem-get-started
```

Now let's install the requirements. But before we do that, we **strongly**
recommend creating a virtual environment with a tool such as
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```console
$ virtualenv -p python3 .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## Existing stages

This project with the help of the Git tags reflects the sequence of actions that
are run in the MLEM [get started](https://mlem.ai/doc/get-started) guide. Feel
free to checkout one of them and play with the MLEM commands having the
playground ready.
